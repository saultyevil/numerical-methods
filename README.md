Python scripts developed as part of the MATH6141 Numerical Methods module at the University of Southampton. Included in the repository is a script for a Python based class test and two pieces of coursewok.

# coursework-1
## runge-kutta
  An explicit and implicit RK3 algorithm which can be used used to find the solution to a non-stiff and to a stiff system respectively. The accuracy of the RK3 algorithms is assessed by comparison to exact solutions.
  
# coursework-2
## hair_sim
  A simulation of hair using polar coordinates in 2 and 3 dimensions. The boundary value problem shooting method is employed to solve a system of two coupled second order differential equations.
## shooting-attempt
  Generic algorithm for shooting to solve a BVP.
