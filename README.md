Storage for my Numerical Methods coursework Python codes.

# class_test
My solutions to the class test.

# coursework-1
## runge-kutta
  An explicit and implicit RK3 algorithm used to find the solution to a non-stiff
  and to a stiff system. Plots the errors and the approximated solutions against
  the exact solutions for both systems and algorithms.

# coursework-2
## hair_sim
  A simulation of hair using spherical polar dimension in 2 and 3 dimensions. The shooting method is employed to solve a system of two coupled second order differential equations.
# shooting-attempt
  Generic method for shooting to solve a BVP.
